# üìä Python Sales Intelligence Toolkit

A collection of five Python-based data analysis projects focused on uncovering insights from product sales data. These projects explore a range of real-world business analytics scenarios, including revenue projections, sales correlations, weather-driven demand, and sentiment-driven performance analysis.

Each project is designed to demonstrate the power of Python in solving practical business problems using data science, visualization, and statistical techniques.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### ‚úÖ **Project 1: Revenue Target Calculator**
**File:** `Revenue Target Calculator Projecting Sales Goals with Python.ipynb`

This project provides a basic simulation to determine whether given sales goals (e.g., $800,000) can be achieved based on unit pricing and expected sales volumes. Ideal for early-stage revenue planning, this calculator helps stakeholders assess how price and quantity interact to meet targets.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Basic arithmetic modeling  
- Business simulation  
- Goal tracking

### ‚úÖ **Project 2: Sales Correlation Analysis (BobaWonder vs. WaterCure)**
**File:** `Sales Correlation Analysis BobaWonder vs. WaterCure.ipynb`

WaterPro launched two products‚ÄîBobaWonder and WaterCure. This project analyzes whether their monthly sales figures are correlated using Pearson correlation coefficient and highlights patterns that may suggest linked customer behavior or promotional impact.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Dictionary-based data modeling  
- Correlation analysis  
- Sales performance comparison

---

### ‚úÖ **Project 3: Temperature Impact on WaterCure Sales**
**File:** `Temperature Impact on Product Demand Analyzing WaterCure Sales.ipynb`  
**Data:** `WaterCure_analysis_Singh_Balbir.csv`

This project investigates how weather‚Äîspecifically temperature‚Äîaffects daily unit sales of WaterCure. By aggregating and visualizing monthly trends, the notebook reveals a strong connection between warmer weather and higher demand for water-based products.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Time series aggregation  
- Temperature vs. sales correlation  
- Data cleaning and conversion

### ‚úÖ **Project 4: Identifying Low-Revenue Months**
**File:** `Identifying Low-Revenue Months Weather Patterns & Sales Drops.ipynb`

This notebook explores revenue performance on a monthly basis. It identifies months where sales fell below $40,000 and analyzes the average temperature during those months. The insights can guide promotional efforts during off-peak periods.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Monthly revenue aggregation  
- Outlier detection  
- External factors influencing sales

### ‚úÖ **Project 5: Customer Feedback & Climate Impact on Product Sales**
**File:** `Customer Feedback and Climate Impact on Product Sales.ipynb`  
**Data:** `Singh_Balbir_Sentiment.csv`

This is a complete analytical package combining customer sentiment (from text reviews) and sales performance (temperature and units sold). It includes:
- Sentiment analysis (VADER)
- Word cloud visualization by sentiment group
- Correlation between sentiment, temperature, and product performance

**Key Concepts:**  
- Sentiment analysis  
- WordCloud generation  
- Multi-factor sales analysis
