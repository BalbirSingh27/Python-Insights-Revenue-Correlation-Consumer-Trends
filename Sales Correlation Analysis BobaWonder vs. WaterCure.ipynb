    "# Sales Correlation Analysis for WaterPro Company\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background and Task Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "WaterPro, a company that introduced two new products, WaterCure and BobaWonder, to the market in January 2024, is interested in understanding the relationship between the sales of these two products. They want to know if good sales performance for BobaWonder correlates with good sales for WaterCure. In other words, the company is curious to see if there is a pattern where high sales of one product are associated with high sales of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation for Correlation Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation analysis allows us to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables â€” in this case, the monthly sales revenues of BobaWonder and WaterCure. By calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient, we can determine whether:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sales of BobaWonder and WaterCure move together in a positive direction (positive correlation),\n",
    "- They move in opposite directions (negative correlation),Or if they are largely unrelated (no significant correlation).\n",
    "- A strong correlation could imply that similar factors influence the sales of both products, whereas a weak or negative correlation may suggest that -their sales are driven by different factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    " To provide insights for WaterPro, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create dictionaries to store the monthly sales data for BobaWonder and WaterCure.\n",
    "- Identify the months with the highest and lowest sales for both products.\n",
    "- Find the months where sales exceeded 750 units for each product.\n",
    "- Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine if there is a relationship between the sales of BobaWonder and WaterCure.\n",
    "- Interpret the results based on the correlation coefficient to offer meaningful insights to the company."

    "- The p-value is very small (likely below 0.05, though not explicitly stated), suggesting that this correlation is statistically significant. A significant p-value means the strong correlation between the sales of BobaWonder and WaterCure is unlikely to have occurred by random chance.\n",
