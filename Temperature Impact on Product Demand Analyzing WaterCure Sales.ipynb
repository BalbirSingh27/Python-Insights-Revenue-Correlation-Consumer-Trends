    "# Background Information:\n",
    "- The company has recently launched two new products, BobaWonder and WaterCure, which were developed as substitute goods for different target audiences. BobaWonder is aimed at bubble tea customers, while WaterCure targets individuals who prefer high-quality water. Surprisingly, the sales data analysis showed a positive correlation between the sales of these two products, which puzzled the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To further investigate this phenomenon, a deeper analysis was conducted, focusing on the relationship between sales and external factors like temperature. The hypothesis is that the observed correlation between the sales of WaterCure units and high temperatures could explain the positive correlation with BobaWonder, as higher temperatures might influence the demand for refreshing products like WaterCure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this analysis, I was provided with a dataset containing the number of WaterCure units sold per day and the daily temperature from January to August 2024 in Australia. The goal of this analysis is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summarize the daily sales and temperature data.\n",
    "2. Examine the correlation between daily units sold and daily temperature.\n",
    "3. Sort the data according to the number of units sold per day.\n",
    "4. Save the sorted data to a new CSV file for further analysis.\n",
    "- This analysis aims to understand the impact of climatic conditions on the sales of WaterCure and to identify whether external factors, such as temperature, might explain the unexpected correlation between the two products."
