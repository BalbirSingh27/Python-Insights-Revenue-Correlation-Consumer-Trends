    "# Background Interpretation:\n",
    "The task revolves around analyzing sales data to determine if specific months had lower sales revenues, which could be influenced by weather conditions (temperature). The objective is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify months where the total sales revenue fell below the threshold of $40,000.\n",
    "2. Calculate the average temperature for these underperforming months, since the company WaterPro believes that weather (temperature) may be a factor affecting sales performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " # Steps in the Analysis:\n",
    "1. Data Cleaning: The raw data provided daily information on WaterCure sales (units sold, unit price, and temperature). The initial rows included irrelevant text, so the dataset was cleaned by skipping unnecessary rows and renaming the columns appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Revenue Calculation: The total daily revenue was computed by multiplying the number of units sold by the unit price. This allowed us to later sum the daily revenues to get monthly totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Monthly Aggregation: Since the data was at the daily level, it was grouped by months to calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total sales revenue for each month.\n",
    "* The average temperature for each month.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. Filtering Low-Revenue Months: After calculating monthly revenues, we identified the months where the revenue fell below $40,000.\n",
    "5. Temperature Analysis: For these underperforming months, we calculated the average temperature using NumPy to help WaterPro understand whether low sales correlate with specific temperature patterns."
